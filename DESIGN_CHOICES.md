# Design Choices

This document outlines the key design decisions made during the development of this project and the rationale behind them.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Project Structure
- **Choice**: Organized code into clear modules/components with separation of concerns (`app/api`, `shared/services`).
- **Rationale**: This structure improves maintainability, testability, and code readability by keeping related logic together. API endpoints are isolated, and the client-side service layer provides a single point of interaction with the backend.
- **Trade-offs**: Slightly more complex initial setup but better long-term maintainability as the project grows.

### 2. Technology Stack
- **Choice**: Next.js 14 (TypeScript), Supabase PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI.
- **Rationale**: 
  - **Next.js 14**: Provides a robust framework for building modern web applications with file-based routing, API routes, and server-side rendering for optimal performance.
  - **Supabase PostgreSQL**: Offers a powerful, managed relational database and a serverless backend with a simple and intuitive API for rapid development.
  - **Tailwind CSS + Material UI**: A hybrid approach that combines the speed and utility-first nature of Tailwind for custom layouts and spacing with the rich, accessible component library of Material UI for complex UI elements like tables, forms, and dialogs.
- **Trade-offs**: The hybrid styling approach can lead to a larger initial bundle size and requires a careful setup to prevent conflicts.

## Data Management

### 1. Data Storage
- **Choice**: Supabase PostgreSQL database.
- **Rationale**: 
  - **Data persistence**: Provides a reliable and persistent storage solution for all customer, order, and sizing data.
  - **Performance and scalability**: PostgreSQL is a highly performant and scalable database, well-suited for a growing e-commerce application.
  - **Ease of use**: Supabase's API and client library simplify database interactions, schema management, and security (via RLS).
- **Trade-offs**: The project is tightly coupled with the Supabase ecosystem, which could introduce vendor lock-in.

### 2. Data Flow
- **Choice**: Unidirectional data flow based on a client-server request/response model.
- **Rationale**: The UI component initiates an action (e.g., `updateOrderItemCustomSize`), which calls a function in the service layer. This function sends a request to a Next.js API endpoint, which then interacts with the Supabase database. This predictable flow simplifies state management and makes debugging easier.
- **Trade-offs**: Manual state management can become complex for very large applications, potentially justifying the use of a dedicated state management library in the future.

## User Interface Design

### 1. UI Framework/Library
- **Choice**: Next.js and Material UI (MUI).
- **Rationale**: 
  - **Component reusability**: MUI provides a comprehensive set of well-documented, pre-built components that can be reused throughout the application.
  - **Development efficiency**: Speeds up development by eliminating the need to build common UI elements from scratch.
  - **Performance**: Next.js handles code splitting and other optimizations to ensure a fast, responsive user experience.
- **Trade-offs**: The MUI library can add a significant amount to the final bundle size.

### 2. Styling Approach
- **Choice**: Tailwind CSS with Material UI.
- **Rationale**: 
  - **Maintainability**: Tailwind's utility classes provide a consistent, constrained design system that is easy to maintain.
  - **Design consistency**: MUI's components ensure a consistent, professional look for complex UI elements without extra effort.
  - **Development speed**: Allows for rapid prototyping and styling without leaving the component file.
- **Trade-offs**: Combining two styling systems can have a learning curve and requires careful configuration to avoid style clashes.

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Optimization Strategies
- **Choice**:
  - **Next.js Built-in Features**: Image optimization, route prefetching, and code splitting are utilized by default.
  - **Efficient API Queries**: Supabase RPCs and JOINs are used to fetch all necessary data in a single API call, reducing network round trips.
  - **Lazy Loading**: `Collapse` components in the UI allow orders to be loaded only when the user expands a customer row, reducing the initial load time.
- **Rationale**: These strategies improve the user experience by reducing page load times and making the application feel more responsive.
- **Trade-offs**: Some of these optimizations add a slight level of complexity to the code.

### 2. Caching Strategy
- **Choice**: No explicit caching layer (e.g., Redis) has been implemented. Client-side data is managed via React state.
- **Rationale**: The application's scale does not yet warrant a dedicated caching solution. The current approach is sufficient for the intended usage.
- **Trade-offs**: For a larger number of concurrent users, a caching layer would be necessary to reduce database load and improve response times.

## Error Handling

### 1. Error Management
- **Choice**: A layered approach to error handling.
  - **Backend (API Routes)**: Uses `try...catch` blocks to catch and log errors, returning standardized JSON error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400, 404, 500).
  - **Frontend (Service Layer)**: Wraps API calls in `try...catch` blocks and throws `Error` objects with descriptive messages.
  - **UI Component**: Catches errors from the service layer and displays them to the user via an `Alert` or `Snackbar` component.
- **Rationale**: This robust strategy ensures a predictable user experience, provides useful debugging information, and prevents the application from crashing on unexpected errors.
- **Trade-offs**: Adds a small amount of boilerplate code to each API route and service function.


## Security Considerations

### 1. Security Measures
- **Choice**:
  - **Supabase RLS (Row-Level Security)**: Implemented to restrict data access based on user roles (although not fully utilized in this client-facing dashboard).
  - **Environment Variables**: Supabase credentials are stored securely as environment variables (`.env.local`) and are not exposed to the client.
  - **Input Validation**: API routes validate user input (e.g., checking for valid UUIDs, allowed status values) to prevent malicious or malformed data from reaching the database.
- **Rationale**: These measures ensure data protection, prevent unauthorized access, and protect against common vulnerabilities.
- **Trade-offs**: RLS can add a small performance overhead to database queries.

## Future Considerations

### 1. Scalability
- **Planned improvements**:
  - Implement server-side pagination and filtering for all API endpoints to handle large datasets more efficiently.
  - Consider adding a caching layer (e.g., with Redis) to reduce load on the database for frequently accessed data.
  - Migrate the database to a more performant plan as the number of users and data grows.
- **Rationale**: Preparation for growth and increased usage.

### 2. Maintainability
- **Code organization**: The current modular design with a clear separation of concerns already provides a good foundation for maintainability.
- **Rationale**: This makes it easier for new developers to understand the project and for existing team members to add new features or fix bugs efficiently.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. What Worked Well
- The **API-first approach** with Next.js API routes proved highly effective, allowing for a clear separation between frontend and backend logic.
- The use of a **dedicated service layer** for data fetching made the UI components cleaner and more focused on presentation.
- The **hybrid styling approach** with Tailwind and MUI allowed for rapid development while maintaining a professional and consistent design.

### 2. What Could Be Improved
- A more structured **client-side state management solution** (e.g., using SWR or React Query) could improve caching and data synchronization across the application.
- The **data generation script** could be expanded to create more diverse and complex mock data, including relationships between all tables, to provide a more realistic testing environment.

### 3. Alternative Approaches Considered
- **All-in-one styling with Tailwind**: An initial thought was to use Tailwind exclusively, but the decision was made to use MUI for its pre-built complex components (like the Table and Select) to save development time.
- **Dedicated backend framework (e.g., Express.js)**: Considered building a separate backend, but Next.js's integrated API routes were chosen for their simplicity, ease of deployment, and tight integration with the frontend.
